# BookLibrary
iOS Assessment - Problem Statement:

Needed to build an iOS application that pulls book information from a library and create an archive with them.You need to be able to search, filter and display the book details on the iOS application itself.
It must be production level deployable app with feature to optimise the api call and not be redundant in terms of data caching ability.
